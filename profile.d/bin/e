# This script makes editing files more pleasant.
#
# Provided you use emacs for editing files, you
# may like this script for launching emacs.
#
# Requirements:
#  * `emacs-autospawn` script by me.
#  * GNU emacs with (server-start in your .emacs)
#  * GNU screen
#
# This script first tests about emacs having already
# been launched with my script.
# If you don't specify a file, the mission of this
# script is to attach you to the running emacs.
#
# If you do specify a file list, then this helper
# runs emacsclient --no-wait and then attaches you
# to the running emacs process.
#
# If anybody comes with an idea on how to replace
# the --no-wait with another kind of job control
# I will take a look at it.
